# Creative Digital Agency Website

## Description

I designed this Creative Digital Agency Website as part of my frontend practice, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project explores responsive design with CSS Grid, featuring a dynamic layout and a JavaScript-based hamburger menu for mobile devices. The website incorporates additional features such as Google Maps integration, a customized scrollbar, a "Go to Top" button, and utilizes Google Fonts for typography, along with Font Awesome icons for enhanced visual elements.
